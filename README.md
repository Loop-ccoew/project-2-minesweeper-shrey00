There is 10*10 grid. 
Player 1 selects locations to place the mines.
Player 2 guesses a location. She loses the game if she selects any mine location. 
If Player 2 guesses any other location, the total mines surrounding the location are displayed there.
The Player can then keep guessing the mine locations.
